# Best Pokémon Teammate

This is a course project that I plan to keep public for future use and interest.

## Have a Pokémon you want to pair with another one? Another three? Five? See if Best Pokémon Teammate can help!

Utilizing a combination of network analysis and machine learning, Best Pokémon Teammate will help you figure out the best teammate or teammates to pair with your initial Pokémon.

Even though an API is used, no keys are required for use! Please let me know if this is ever changed in the future.

First, specify whether you'd like to view the modeling visuals. They aren't needed, but are pretty cool to see at least once! Next, simply enter the requested information, or not--it'll work either way. Keep getting teammate(s) as much as you want! Just enter "quit" to stop at any point.

Thanks for reading! I hope this gives you some new Pokémon teammate ideas to try out.
